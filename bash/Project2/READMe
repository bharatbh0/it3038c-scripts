Copy and paste the code in your codespace and type : python3 cal.py

Once you have it running choose one of the inout from (1-5):
   #print("Calculator ")
   #print("1 for Addition")
   #print("2 for Subtraction")
   #print("3 for Multiplication")
   #print("4 for Division")
   #print("5 for Exponentiation")
   
Once you chose (1-5) next is choosing your first number than your second:
#Enter your First choice: ..
#Enter your Second choice: ..

You should be able to see the full display of choice 1 and 2 and your answer below it.
#4 / 4
#Answer is: 1

After you have the choice of continuing for asking a different question.

I used a while loop since it makes it easy for a loop to continue so that the user can keep inputting new calculations.
#while True:
  ....choice=input("Enter.....")
  ....
  ....
  
 #else:
        #print("Invalded Choice: Try again") #This is when your number can't be found or you typed a letter.
        
    #a = input("continue? (Y/N): ") #This is after you have gotten the answer and if you want ask another question or quit.
    #if a == "Y":
        #choice() #If Y go back to choice=input("Enter....")
    #elif a == "N":
        #print("Shutting down...") #If N than quit
        #break
    #else:
        #print("Invalied input") #Anything other than Y or N print invalied and quit
       #break
