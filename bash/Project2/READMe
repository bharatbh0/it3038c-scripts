//Copy and paste the code in your codespace and type : python3 cal.py

//Once you have it running choose one of the inout from (1-5):
   #print("Calculator ")
   #print("1 for Addition")
   #print("2 for Subtraction")
   #print("3 for Multiplication")
   #print("4 for Division")
   #print("5 for Exponentiation")
   #print("6 for Quit")
   
//I chose to input this code above my choices since it would ask me for my first and second number if this was below and then quit. 
    # if choice == "6":
       # print("Shutting down...")
       # break
   
//Once you chose (1-6) next is choosing your first number than your second:
#Enter your First choice: ..
#Enter your Second choice: ..

//You should be able to see the full display of choice 1 and 2 and your answer below it.
#4 / 4
#Answer is: 1

//After you have the choice of continuing for asking a different question.

//I used a while loop since it makes it easy for a loop to continue so that the user can keep inputting new calculations.
#while True:
  ....choice=input("Enter.....")
  ....
  ....
  
 #else:
    #print("Invalid Choice: Try again") //Anything thats a str will return invalid 
      
    #a = input("Tap Enter to continue: ") //I choose to add this so that the loop wouldn't start right after giving the answer.
